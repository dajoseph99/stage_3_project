Hello there.

I selected 6 teen movies from the 1980’s to showcase on the Movie Trailer Website.  

Including this read.txt file, you will need to download:
media.py
entertainment_center.py
fresh_tomatoes.py

Save the files in the same folder.  Make sure Python is installed on your computer.  I developed the Movie Website on a Mac with Python 2.7.10.

Open a Terminal window.  Navigate to the folder where three files have been stored and, at the commend line, enter, python entertainment_center.py

Using the above command, the code will execute and open a web page that displays 6 movie posters.  Click on the movie poster and the movie’s trailer will open in a separate window.

Thanks,

Doug
